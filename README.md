# Learn Reactivex using tests

Learning Reactivex (Observables, Observers, operators etc), is not easy.

One way I found quite successful is to write tests to confirm what will happen in various scenarios and try out various methods to achieve a goal.

This also makes it possible to verify what happens to subscriptions, whether they are disposed as expected

## Run

```poetry run pytest```
