# Learn Reactivex using tests

The `learn_reactive_by_testing` module contains a collection of tests designed to help developers learn how to write reactive code using the [ReactiveX library](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY/). The tests cover a range of concepts and techniques, and can be used as a learning resource or a reference guide for writing reactive code.

The available tests are organized into several categories, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of reactive programming:

## Operators
The operators tests cover the various operators that can be used to manipulate and transform observables, such as map, filter, and merge. These tests demonstrate how to use operators to compose observables and perform complex operations.

## Subject
The subjects tests cover the use of subjects, which can be used to create observables that can be both subscribed to and emitted to. These tests demonstrate how to use subjects to create complex data flows.

## Disposables

## Returns (not from RxPy)

Tests a few usage of Maybe and Result from [Returns library](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)

## Flow
Slightly more advanced flows using combination of operators/observables

## Cookbook

Some common use cases, similar to the Flow section

## Run

To run the tests, it is recommended to use VSCode. After installing VSCode, open the repository in the editor. From there, use the "Run and Debug"  tab in VSCode to run various tests. You can open the test files you wish to investigate, and add breakpoints for additional investigation. Running the tests in VSCode will provide a detailed output that shows the results of each test, along with any errors or failures that may have occurred.
